# cyberdefender-club
This is a website I created for the CyberDefenders Club at Tarrant County College
This is not the version that ended up getting used, though I created both versions. The other version was chosen after it was discovered that the school's firewall only allowed very specific hosting services and that the hosting service could not be payed for club funds.\n
However, this is my favorite version that best showcases my abilities.
